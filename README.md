<p>Hi :wave: my names Brooklyn, I'm in college studying: A Level Computer Science & Double Applied Science. My interests are in networking, infrastructure and web development.</p>

<br>

<p>I'm also an open source enthusiast and occasionally make contributions or provide help in my spare time. The language I use day-to-day is Python, but I'm currently learning C++. Feel free to contact me on Discord; <strong>Brooklyn#4333</strong></p>
